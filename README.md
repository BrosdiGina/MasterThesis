# Master Thesis Project

This code implements a model able to make extroverted sentences introverted and vice versa. The study is based on a previous work discussed in [LG G WATCH R](https://www.lg.com/wearable-technology/lg-G-Watch-R-W110)



[Taking Care of the Linguistic Feature of Extraversion] (https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3af6/a855b58a56c4ddb87caa24dce52c620d12ef.pdf)

## Run the Project

To obtain the english version of the ontology, open a new terminal and launch:

```
$ cd src/code_english_version
$ python main.py
```
For the italian version:

```
$ cd src/code_italian_version
$ python main.py
```

Two different output files will be created representing respectively the ontology for the extrovert personality and the introvert one.
