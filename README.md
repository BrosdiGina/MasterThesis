# Master Thesis Project

This code implements a model able to make extroverted sentences introverted and vice versa. The study is based on a previous work discussed in [Taking Care of the Linguistic Features of Extraversion.](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3af6/a855b58a56c4ddb87caa24dce52c620d12ef.pdf)
The model has been tested using the sentences made available by the ontology created for the [CARESSES Project.](http://caressesrobot.org/en/)

## Run the Project

To obtain the english version of the ontology, open a new terminal and launch:

```
$ cd src/code_english_version
$ python main.py
```
For the italian version:

```
$ cd src/code_italian_version
$ python main.py
```

Two different output files will be created representing respectively the ontology for the extrovert personality and the introvert one.
